# Vaccine Tracker Program
#### COP5230 - Object Oriented Programming Essentials
#### Summer 2025

## Project Journey

Coming from a software engineering background, I was already familiar with clean code practices and software design principles. However, this course helped me dive deeper into the theoretical foundations of OOP and enhanced my existing knowledge. What started as a CLI application evolved into something much more sophisticated, allowing me to apply academic concepts to practical software development.

The project began as a command-line interface for vaccine tracking. While I could have jumped straight into implementing a complex solution, the course structure helped me appreciate the step-by-step evolution of software design. Starting with basic procedural programming helped reinforce fundamental concepts before moving into more advanced OOP patterns.

The transition to OOP was particularly interesting because it allowed me to compare industry practices with academic theory. Breaking down the application into classes like `VaccineRecord` and `Patient` wasn't just about organization - it was about understanding the deeper principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism that I use daily in my work.

The GUI implementation went through an interesting evolution. We started with tkinter for basic UI concepts, but then transitioned to pygame and pygwidgets for a more robust and engaging user interface. This progression helped me understand different approaches to GUI development in Python. The final version using pygame/pygwidgets offers features like:
- Add and manage patient records
- Track different types of vaccines
- View vaccination history
- Generate reports
- Search and filter patient data

## Project Structure
- `gui/`: Contains all the pygame/pygwidgets GUI implementation
- `classes/`: Core classes for the business logic
- `systems/`: Backend functionality and data management
- `main.py`: Entry point of the application

## Technical Insights
This project reinforced and expanded my understanding of:
- OOP theory and its practical applications
- Clean architecture principles in Python
- GUI development progression (CLI → tkinter → pygame/pygwidgets)
- The bridge between academic concepts and real-world implementation
- Advanced error handling and input validation
- Data persistence patterns

## Running the Program
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run: `python main.py`

## Special Thanks
I want to express my gratitude to Professor Pazos-Revilla for providing a perfect blend of theoretical foundations and practical applications. His approach to teaching OOP concepts has given me valuable insights that I'll carry into my MS in Computer Science program next fall. Special thanks also to TA Zachary Hinnen for the constructive feedback throughout the course. This class has been an excellent bridge between my industry experience and academic pursuits.
